The assignment was to refactor code for the client's website. The main goal was to make the site function propoerly, be more accessible, and have better structure in the underlying code.

To accomplish this, here is a high-level list of what I did:
1. Update the client site's HTML utilized semantic elements
2. Consolidate, simplify, and add comments to the CSS
3. Structure the HTML in a more logical and readable way
4. Add accessibility features, such as ALT descriptions on images
5. Ensure all links were working appropriately
6. Ensure there was a descriptive title for the website
